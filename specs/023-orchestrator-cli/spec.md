  The observatory binary gains an `orchestrator` command group that is a
  pure client of the HTTP API: status, dag, next, start/pause/resume, spec
  controls (skip, retry-stage, reverify, force-gate, approve), decisions
  search, history, journal verify (offline, direct), and daemon
  start/stop/status with the identity-checked lock. Anything the UI can
  do, the CLI can do; several things (journal verify, daemon lifecycle)
  only the CLI does.

# 023: Orchestrator CLI

## 1. Purpose

CLI-first control keeps the orchestrator scriptable and honest: if a
capability exists, it is reachable from a terminal and therefore from
automation and tests.

## 2. Territory

`src/commands/orchestrator.ts`; one additive dispatch case in
`src/index.ts` (owned by spec 005, extended here); and the two operator
scripts at the repository root, `start.sh` and `stop.sh` (B-5, D-11).

## 3. Behavior

- **B-1 (client, not engine).** Every command except `journal verify` and
  `daemon start|stop|status` talks to the API through the generated typed
  client (spec 022 FR-002). No command re-derives state locally while a
  daemon is running.
- **B-2 (verbs).** `observatory orchestrator projects [add <path> |
  arm|disarm|requalify|remove <name>] | status | dag | next | start |
  pause | resume | history | decisions <query> | spec <id>
  skip|retry|reverify|force-gate|approve | journal verify | daemon
  start|stop|status`. Amended to v2 by spec 028's build session under the
  authority 028 §2 grants: `status` through `spec` each take
  `--project <name>` to scope them to one registered project (028 B-2),
  `journal verify` takes `--project <name>` or `--dir <path>` to choose
  the state root it walks (028 B-3), and `projects add` takes `--name
  <slug>` and `--disarmed`.
- **B-3 (output).** Human-readable by default, `--json` for the raw
  envelope; exit codes: 0 ok, 1 operational failure, 2 unreachable daemon,
  3 usage. Human output states estimates as estimates (quota).
- **B-4 (offline verify).** `journal verify` walks both chains (011, 020)
  directly and works with no daemon running; it is the operator's
  independent check, so it must not depend on the API.

- **B-5 (operator scripts).** `./start.sh` boots the checkout in one
  command: preflight (bun, spec-spine, git on PATH), `bun install
  --frozen-lockfile`, `bun run web:build` (the dashboard is served from
  the gitignored `web/dist`, spec 024), `orchestrator daemon start`, the
  observatory watcher's `daemon start` (spec 007 B-1), then both status
  views and the dashboard address. `./stop.sh` reverses it: `orchestrator
  daemon stop` (one SIGTERM and a wait for the lock, 021 B-6) and the
  watcher's `daemon stop` (007 B-2), polling the watcher's old pid so
  "stopped" is observed rather than assumed. `start.sh --restart` runs
  stop first; `--skip-build` and `--no-watcher` skip those steps. Neither
  script escalates to SIGKILL or adds a verb: each step is one of the CLI
  verbs above, and the exit code is the first failing step's.

## 4. Functional requirements

- **FR-001.** Command tests run against a fixture API server; usage errors
  are tested for exit code 3 and a usage line on stderr.
- **FR-002.** The spec 005 usage text gains one line for the group;
  existing commands are untouched.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1.** `bun test` for the CLI territory passes.
- **AC-2.** With the daemon from spec 021's fixture running,
  `observatory orchestrator status --json` returns the documented envelope.

## 6. Out of scope

Interactive TUI, shell completions, and configuration profiles.

## 7. Resolved decisions

D-1. `status` is the composite read, and v2 makes it two of them (amended
by spec 028's build session under the authority 028 §2 grants). Without
`--project` it fetches `/api/meta`, `/api/quota`, and `/api/projects` and
renders the daemon's own state (standby, driving, parked), the account's
one quota pool, and one row per project; `--json` prints
`{ok: true, data: {meta, quota, projects}}` composed from the three served
envelopes, whose payloads are the `ApiMeta`, `QuotaView`, and
`ProjectsView` types verbatim from `types.ts`. With `--project <name>` it
fetches that project's `/api/projects/<name>/run` plus the global
`/api/quota` and prints `{ok: true, data: {run, quota}}`, the original
composition against v2's shapes. Every other API-backed command maps to
exactly one route and prints that route's envelope unchanged. B-3 requires
human output to call an estimated quota horizon an estimate, and a run view
alone cannot do that (a parked run reads as idle); composing already-shared
shapes adds no further declaration of the contract.

D-2. The group gains a fourth daemon verb, `daemon run`: the foreground
process that composes `createProductionDaemonDeps`, `Daemon.start()` (spec
021 B-2's lock, journals, recovery, loop) and `createApiServer` (spec 022),
and the thing `daemon start` spawns detached with its log at
`data/orchestrator/daemon.log`. B-2 names start, stop, and status, but
nothing in the repository composed a daemon with its API, so those three
verbs would have had no process to manage. Shutdown is composed here rather
than delegated to `installShutdownSignalHandler`: SIGTERM stops the HTTP
server first, then calls the daemon's own `shutdown()`, so no client can
reach a daemon that has already released its journals.

A-1 (2026-08-01, recorded by spec 026's build session under the authority
its §2 grants). What `daemon run` composes changed, additively: the
foreground process boots spec 026's standby daemon (identity lock, project
registry, the one flight slot) rather than a single `Daemon`, so it
outlives a terminal run and keeps serving instead of exiting with the API
and the UI. `--repo` keeps its meaning: a registry chain that has never
held a record registers that checkout as its first project. The shutdown
shape above is unchanged, one level up: SIGTERM stops the HTTP server
first, then the standby daemon, which inherits 021 B-6 and D-2 for
whichever run holds the slot. Until spec 027's project-scoped routes land,
the control routes address the run holding the slot, or the single paused
run when the daemon is in standby, and refuse with the candidates named
rather than guessing.

D-3. That hosted API reads both chains from their files
(`journalViewFromDir`), not from the daemon's handle. Spec 022's
`journalViewFromHandle` hands the API a view over the live handle, but that
handle is a private field of the `Daemon` class and spec 011's per-chain lock
refuses a second writer, so an in-process API can obtain neither. The file view re-parses only when size or
mtime changes and stops at the first line that does not parse or does not
continue the sequence, which is the torn tail journal.ts's own open-time
recovery drops as well. It can only report what the daemon has already
fsynced, and it can never append. The cleaner alternative (a read accessor
on `Daemon`) sits in spec 021's territory.

D-4. Only `unreachable` maps to exit 2; every other error kind,
`malformed-response` included, is an operational failure and exits 1, since
a daemon that answered off-contract is running and broken, not absent.
Usage errors (no command, unknown command, unknown flag, a flag missing its
value, an unknown verb, a trailing argument) print the reason and the usage
block to stderr and exit 3. `daemon status` also exits 2 when no live lock
holder exists, so one code answers "there is no daemon" whether the question
went over HTTP or to the lock file.

D-5. The offline commands (B-4's `journal verify`, and the daemon lifecycle)
answer in the same envelope under `--json`, always `ok: true`, with the
verdict inside `data` (`verified`, `running`, `staleLock`, `ready`) and the
outcome in the exit code. A tampered chain is
`{ok: true, data: {verified: false, ...}}` with exit 1, and a missing anchor
is reported the same way rather than thrown. The error kinds are the API's
vocabulary for what a request did, and no request was made.

D-6. One `--url` base address serves both halves: it tells a client where to
look and tells `daemon run|start` where to bind, resolved as `--url`, then
`OBSERVATORY_ORCHESTRATOR_URL`, then `http://127.0.0.1:4519`. Separate bind
and client knobs are how an operator starts a daemon on one port and queries
another with no error anywhere. Unknown flags are refused rather than
ignored: spec 005 records silent flag-swallowing as a defect, and in a
control plane whose verbs journal irreversible facts, `--jsonn` quietly
executing the verb in human mode is worse than an annoyance.

D-7. The CLI's spec verbs are aliases over the API's (`retry` ->
`retry-stage`, `force-gate` -> `force-human-gate`, with the long forms
accepted too), so B-2's grammar and spec 022 B-5's routes are one set of
verbs under two names. Every control the CLI issues carries
`X-Control-Source: cli`, so the record the daemon journals names the
terminal rather than defaulting to `api`, which is what lets the ledger
distinguish an operator's action from the web UI's.

D-8 (operator, 2026-08-02). Found by this spec's first live
re-qualification (021 D-18): the unreachable-client assertion targeted
the default port, and re-qualification runs from a daemon that is, by
construction, alive and serving it, so the assertion failed against the
very machinery verifying it. The assertion now targets a scratch loopback
port: it asserts the client's honesty about an absent server, which was
always its point, not the accident of an idle machine. The daemon's tests
passed in the same requalification, so this was the only environmental
dependence in the section.

## Verification

```verify:cli
bun test src/commands/orchestrator.test.ts
```

```verify:cli
# The client must exit 2 (unreachable), the documented honest outcome,
# never a crash, when nothing answers. Asserted against a scratch loopback
# port (D-8): the default port may legitimately hold a live daemon while
# this runs, re-qualification included, and the assertion is about the
# client's honesty, not about the operator's machine being idle.
bun src/index.ts orchestrator status --url http://127.0.0.1:4599 --json > /dev/null 2>&1; test $? -eq 2
```

D-9 (2026-08-02, operator-directed fix wave). The status/run views' blocker
list is the run's own journaled stop reason (`run.blocked`), a historical
fact that a later requalification can heal without the run record changing;
rendered bare it read as a live claim the scheduler contradicted (found
live: after 023/026 requalified and 028 built, `status` still showed the
stale cascade). The render now labels it "blocked (journaled at run stop;
`dag` shows the live view):" rather than recomputing it, because the run
view reports the run, and the dag view, whose fold 027 D-6 brought to
scheduler parity, is the live surface.

D-10 (2026-08-04, operator). `cmdDaemonRun` wires 026 D-7's `readCodeSha`
with a process-local git HEAD read rooted at the code checkout this
module was loaded from (two levels above the commands directory), never
at `--repo`: the two coincide for the self-hosted daemon, but only the
former names the running modules.

D-11 (operator, 2026-09-01). The scripts exist because the operational
rule spec 026 D-7 encodes (after a self-repo merge the daemon announces
code-stale and idles until an operator restarts it) had no one-command
answer: a restart meant remembering the dashboard build, two daemons, and
their order. They compose the existing verbs rather than adding any (B-1's
point: everything is already reachable from a terminal), so they can never
do what the CLI cannot, and `stop.sh` inherits `daemon stop`'s refusal to
escalate to SIGKILL: a daemon that ignores SIGTERM is reported with its pid
and lock path, and the operator decides. The watcher half is opt-out rather
than opt-in because the README names both layers as the product;
`--no-watcher` is for a machine that only drives builds. They are owned
here rather than by 007 or 021 because they are a composition over this
file's lifecycle verbs, the same layer B-1 places `daemon start|stop|status`
in; 007 and 021 keep owning what the signals do once delivered.
