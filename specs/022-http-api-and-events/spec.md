  The daemon's single interface: a typed localhost HTTP API (Bun.serve)
  plus a server-sent-events stream with heartbeat, after the statecraft
  admin-stream pattern. Read endpoints cover the DAG with readiness and
  blockers, run state, stage evidence, quota state, decision-ledger
  queries, and run history; control endpoints cover start, pause, resume,
  skip, retry-stage, re-run-verify, and force-human-gate. Every response
  shape is a versioned TypeScript type shared with the clients; errors use
  one envelope with stable kind tokens. Localhost-only binding in v1, but
  nothing in the shapes assumes single-user forever.

# 022: HTTP API and event stream

## 1. Purpose

Every surface (CLI, web UI, tests, future integrations) is a client of this
API. One interface means state honesty has one place to live.

## 2. Territory

`src/orchestrator/api/` (server, routes, types, SSE fan-out, tests).

## 3. Behavior

- **B-1 (binding).** `127.0.0.1` only, default port 4519, configurable;
  refuses non-loopback binds in v1. No auth in v1 (loopback trust),
  designed so an auth layer slots in front without shape changes.
- **B-2 (envelope).** Success: `{ok: true, data}`; failure: `{ok: false,
  error: {kind, message}}` with stable kind tokens
  (statecraft-cli output pattern). All shapes exported from
  `src/orchestrator/api/types.ts` with an `apiVersion` constant served at
  `/api/meta`.
- **B-3 (reads).** Amended to the v2 contract by spec 027 B-3, which scopes
  every project-scoped read under `/api/projects/<name>/`:
  `/api/projects/<name>/dag` (specs with status, readiness, blockers,
  pins, invalidation), `/api/projects/<name>/run` (current run, spec,
  stage, attempt), `/api/projects/<name>/decisions?query=` (spec 020 B-5),
  `/api/projects/<name>/history` (spec executions with evidence refs: PR,
  CI conclusion, verify verdict), `/api/projects/<name>/evidence/<hash>`
  (content-addressed evidence files, read-only). Each payload carries its
  project name. `/api/quota` (state, target, estimated flag, consecutive
  parks) stays global: the account's quota is one pool (026 B-5).
- **B-4 (events).** `/api/events`: SSE with `retry: 3000`, 15 s comment
  heartbeat, subscription to journal appends, state transitions, session
  stream summaries (bounded), and quota ticks; ring-buffered replay of the
  last 256 events via `Last-Event-ID`.
- **B-5 (controls).** Amended to the v2 contract by spec 027 B-5, which
  scopes every control to a named project: POST
  `/api/projects/<name>/run/start|pause|resume`,
  `/api/projects/<name>/spec/<id>/skip|retry-stage|reverify|force-human-gate`,
  `/api/projects/<name>/spec/<id>/approve` (releases a human gate).
  Controls return the journaled control record; idempotent where the verb
  implies it. An unknown project name answers `not-found`.
- **B-6 (honesty).** Read endpoints serve only journal-derived state; there
  is no cached status that can disagree with a fold. Unknowns serialize as
  explicit unknowns.

## 4. Functional requirements

- **FR-001.** Route tests run against an in-process server with a fixture
  journal; SSE tests assert heartbeat cadence and replay.
- **FR-002.** A generated `api-client.ts` (typed fetch wrapper over the
  shared types) is exported for the CLI and web UI to consume.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1.** `bun test src/orchestrator/api/` passes.
- **AC-2.** `curl` of every read endpoint against a fixture daemon returns
  the documented envelope and types round-trip through the client.

## 6. Out of scope

Authentication, TLS, remote binding, GraphQL-style querying, and API
stability guarantees beyond `apiVersion` gating.

## 7. Resolved decisions

D-1. `POST /api/run/start` (B-5) means "ensure the run is running", never
"boot a daemon". Spec 021 B-2 fixes the boot order (lock, journals,
recovery, then the loop *and* this API), so by the time an HTTP request can
arrive the process is already up, and process lifecycle belongs to spec 023's
`daemon start|stop|status`. Within a hosted daemon, start delegates to
`resume` when the run is `paused`, is an idempotent no-op returning
`applied: false` when the run is already `running`, and is refused with
`conflict` when the run is `parked` (the quota scheduler's own countdown owns
that state, spec 015 B-3), `completed`, or `failed` (terminal sinks in spec
013's transition table). A journal with no run at all is also a conflict.
The `ControlTarget` seam therefore has no `start` member; it is exactly spec
021 B-4's seven control methods, which the `Daemon` class satisfies with no
adapter (asserted at compile time in `server.test.ts`).

D-2. The control record B-5 promises is diffed out of the journal, never
written by the API: a handler snapshots the record count, invokes the
daemon's own control method, and returns the first record that call appended
whose kind starts with `control.`. This module appends nothing to either
chain, so the daemon stays the single author of the fact and the response is
literally a read of what was journaled. An idempotent no-op returns
`applied: false` with `record: null` rather than a synthesized record.

D-3. `/api/evidence/<hash>` answers in the same envelope as every other read
route (`{hash, mediaType, bytes, text, base64}`, the unused body field
explicitly null), since AC-2 requires the documented envelope from every read
endpoint and the typed client can only cover a route that speaks it. The same
URL with `?raw=1` additionally serves the bytes with their own content type,
which is what spec 024 B-5's `<img src>` needs. Both forms require a
64-lowercase-hex hash, so nothing outside the evidence directory is
reachable.

D-4. B-4's "bounded" is implemented by replacement, not truncation: an event
whose payload encodes to more than 4096 characters streams as
`{bounded: true, seq, kind, chars}` and the client refetches derived state
from the read routes. A `session.result` payload carries a 16 KB stderr tail
that would otherwise dominate the 256-event ring, and a silently shortened
tail reads as the whole tail, which is what B-6 forbids. Quota ticks are
synthesized on a 15 s cadence while the run is parked, computed from the
journaled target each time (spec 015 B-2's "derived, not stored ticking
state").

D-5. `/api/dag` applies spec 021 D-5's own mask before computing
`nextReady`: every spec the journal shows shipped, or an operator has
skipped through a control, is overridden to a non-pending sentinel. The
target repo's registry only flips `implementation` once the build session's
frontmatter edit is merged and re-read, so an unmasked answer would name a
spec the daemon has demonstrably finished. Each node still reports the
registry's raw `implementation` plus a `skipped` flag, so nothing is hidden.

D-6. A spec file that cannot be read is reported as a pin error
(`currentPin: null`, `pinError` filled), never as pin drift: the lookup
handed to `invalidatedSet`/`nextReady` falls back to the pin recorded when
that spec shipped, so spec 012 B-4's invalidation cascade never fires on the
strength of an I/O error, and one missing file does not take down the whole
view.

D-7. B-4's "subscription to journal appends" is a pump, not a listener:
journal.ts (spec 011's territory) exposes no append hook, and adding one from
here would edit an owning spec's file. The pump polls the same read-only
`JournalView` the GET routes fold, starting from the journal's current tail,
so a stream never replays a whole run as if it were happening now and nothing
can be announced over SSE that a later fold would deny.

D-8. FR-002's "generated" client is route-table driven rather than
code-generated: `api-client.ts` takes every path from the shared
`API_ROUTES` table and every payload type from `types.ts`, so neither can
drift without failing typecheck, and the repo keeps its no-build-step
convention. Under v2 the table splits with the router: `API_ROUTES` holds the
global paths and `PROJECT_ROUTES` the scoped suffixes. Control routes validate
a spec id by shape only, not registry membership, so a control never fails for
a `spec-spine` subprocess's reasons. `apiVersion` gating is opt-in: a request
declaring `X-Api-Version` is held to it, one declaring nothing is served on the
current version's assumption, which is what keeps plain `curl` the first-class
client AC-2 makes it. Spec 027 B-1 sets that current version to 2 and refuses a
request declaring version 1.

## Verification

```verify:cli
bun test src/orchestrator/api/
```

D-9 (2026-08-06, operator). `Bun.serve` runs with `idleTimeout: 0`,
deliberately: the runtime's default 10 s idle timeout severed every
quiet SSE stream (B-4 holds a connection open between journal appends,
which standby can space minutes apart) and logged a "[Bun.serve]:
request timed out" line for each kill. The listener is loopback-only
and every JSON route answers within one fold, so the timeout's only
observed effect was breaking the one route built to stay open. A
client that vanishes without closing costs a lingering socket on
localhost, accepted and recorded here.

D-10 (2026-08-10, operator). `stop()` yields one event-loop tick between
closing the SSE controllers and awaiting `Bun.serve`'s `stop(true)`.
Found live as the intermittent 026 B-7 violation of 2026-08-06 (SIGTERM
in standby ignored, SIGKILL needed; distinct from 2026-08-05's
starved-event-loop violation, which 026 D-10 fixed): on Bun 1.3.11,
closing two or more stream controllers and calling `stop(true)` in the
same event-loop turn leaves that promise forever pending, even though
every socket and the listener are torn down at the OS level. The daemon's
signal handler awaits this `stop()` before anything else and latches its
re-entry guard, so the leaked promise made the process deaf to every
later TERM while the scheduler loop kept running; the operator's web
dashboard tab held one reconnecting SSE stream open, so any second
client (a curl, a second tab) at stop time crossed the two-stream
threshold, which is what made the hang look intermittent. One client,
or force-stop without the pre-close, or a tick between the closes and
the stop, all resolve; five-of-five reproduction each way. The pre-close
stays (it is what ends the heartbeat timers and unsubscribes the hub);
the tick is the fix. Residual risk accepted: a future Bun regression of
the same class would hang the same await again, and the signal path
deliberately stays simple rather than growing a watchdog for it.
