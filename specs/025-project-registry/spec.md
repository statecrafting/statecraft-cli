summary: >
  The registry of target repositories the orchestrator may drive: a third
  hash-linked chain (the spec 011 envelope under a caller-chosen basename)
  living in the daemon home, folded into the current set of projects. A
  project is a named, absolute repo path with an armed flag and a recorded
  qualification verdict. Qualification is a read-only preflight (git repo
  with an origin remote, spec-spine compile green in the target, specs
  present); unqualified projects stay visible with their reasons and are
  never scheduled. Per-project orchestrator state lives inside each target
  at data/orchestrator/, byte-compatible with the self-hosted layout.

# 025: Project registry

## 1. Purpose

Generalizing the orchestrator (010 A-1) starts with an honest answer to
"what may this daemon touch, and why". The registry is that answer: every
target is registered, qualified, and journaled before a single session is
driven against it.

## 2. Territory

`src/orchestrator/projects.ts` and its colocated tests. Storage is a third
chain in the daemon home, `data/orchestrator/projects.jsonl` (with its
anchor), reusing spec 011's `openJournal(dir, basename)` seam exactly as
the decision ledger (020) does.

## 3. Behavior

- **B-1 (model).** A project is `{name, repoDir, armed, qualification}`:
  `name` a unique slug (the registry's key and the API path segment),
  `repoDir` an absolute path, `armed` per 010 D14, `qualification` the
  latest recorded verdict with reasons. The self-hosted checkout is not
  special: it is simply the first registered project.
- **B-2 (chain, not table).** Registry state is derived by folding the
  projects chain; register, arm, disarm, requalify, and remove are each an
  appended record carrying its source (cli, api, ui), never an in-place
  mutation. The chain verifies with spec 011's `verifyChain`.
- **B-3 (two roots).** The daemon home (this checkout's
  `data/orchestrator/`: lock, log, projects chain) is where the daemon
  lives. A project's state root (`<repoDir>/data/orchestrator/`: work
  journal, decision ledger, evidence) is where facts about that project
  live, in exactly today's self-hosted layout, so spec 011/020 machinery
  and offline `journal verify` work unchanged when pointed at any project.
- **B-4 (qualification).** A read-only preflight against the target
  records a verdict with per-check reasons: it is a git repository with an
  `origin` remote and a resolvable default branch; `spec-spine compile`
  exits green run inside it; its specs directory exists and is non-empty.
  A failing target registers as unqualified (visible, reasons served),
  never silently dropped. Qualification also warns, without fixing, when
  the target does not gitignore `data/`: the orchestrator never edits a
  target's authored files itself.
- **B-5 (write discipline).** Outside driven sessions, the orchestrator
  process writes nothing in a target except its state root. `~/.claude`
  stays read-only for every code path (spec 001 B-7, inherited unchanged).

## 4. Functional requirements

- **FR-001.** Fold tests cover register, arm/disarm, requalify, remove,
  and re-register; chain verification passes over every fixture history.
- **FR-002.** Qualification tests run against fixture directories: a
  governed repo, a repo without origin, a non-repo, and a governed repo
  whose `data/` is not gitignored (qualifies, with the warning recorded).

## 5. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1.** `bun test src/orchestrator/projects.test.ts` passes.
- **AC-2.** `verifyChain` passes over the projects chain produced by
  AC-1's histories.

## 6. Out of scope

Scheduling (spec 026 owns which project runs), API and UI surfaces (027,
029), cross-project dependency edges, and any mutation of a target's
authored files.

## 7. Resolved decisions

D-1. `name` is a lowercase slug (`[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*`), chosen at
registration (defaulting to the repoDir basename, slugified) and unique
among non-removed projects. Slugs keep the name safe as an API path
segment with no escaping (027 relies on this).

D-2. Remove is a tombstone: the chain is append-only, so removal appends a
record and the fold drops the project. Re-registering the same name later
resumes the same state root in the target; the project's journal history
is the target's property and is never deleted by the orchestrator.

D-7 (2026-08-05, spec 034's build, per its granted authority).
QualificationVerdict gains an optional `adoptable` reading (034 B-5),
computed only by qualifyProject(): true exactly when the verdict is
unqualified, the three soundness checks (git-repo, origin-remote,
default-branch) pass, and specs-present fails. A red compile beside an
empty specs/ does not block the reading (it is the expected consequence of
having nothing to compile); a corpus that is present but compiles red is
never adoptable, because that target needs fixing, not adopting. The
payload codec writes the field explicitly on every new record and reads an
absent one as false, so pre-034 records fold unreinterpreted; the field is
optional on the type so hand-built verdicts (fixtures, older callers) stay
constructible and can never claim adoptability by accident. Scheduling is
untouched: adoptable implies unqualified, which spec 026 already refuses
to drive.

D-8 (2026-08-06, spec 036's build, per its granted authority). The module
gains the ratification-input record vocabulary (036 B-3): the
`adopt.validated` kind, `journalValidation()` writing the corpus pin,
target window, and full score, and `parseValidation()` with
`latestValidation()` reading the newest verdict back out of a project's
work-journal records. The record lives in the target's own work journal
rather than this registry's chain (036 D-4 names why: the standby daemon
holds the projects chain's writer open for its whole life, and validate
is offline); this module still owns the codec, so the arm path and every
projects surface read the verdict through one place. The registry fold
is untouched: no projects-chain kind is added, and foldProjects ignores
the new kind as it ignores every kind it does not own.
projects.test.ts gains the 036 FR-003 round-trip coverage.
