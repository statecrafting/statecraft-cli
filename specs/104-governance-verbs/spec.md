summary: >
  The CLI face becomes useful: the stub commands from spec 102 gain
  real implementations over the API client, mirroring the control
  plane's tenants (statecraft spec 004), factory (spec 005), and fleet
  (spec 106) services. Every verb has a stable JSON output shape,
  because spec 105 exposes these same verbs as MCP tools and the JSON
  is the shared contract between both faces.

# 104: Governance verbs

## 1. Cross-repo dependency

Endpoint shapes are defined by the statecraft repo's specs 004/005/006
and inlined below as the CLI's expectation; if the live control plane
diverges, the platform spec wins: update the shapes here via amendment
rather than coding to drift. Services that do not exist yet on the
target plane must surface as "not enabled on this control plane"
(HTTP 404 from a missing service), exit 1, not a crash.

## 2. Verb surface (all support --output json)

- `statecraft tenants list` -> GET /api/v1/tenants
- `statecraft tenants show <id>` -> GET /api/v1/tenants/:id (includes
  installations)
- `statecraft tenants install-url <id>` -> GET
  /api/v1/tenants/:id/github/install-url (prints the URL; `--open`
  opens the browser)
- `statecraft stamp new --tenant <id> --app <name> --org <org>
  [--frontend vue] --posture <none|assisted|autonomous>` -> POST
  /api/v1/tenants/:id/stamps. Posture is a REQUIRED flag with no
  default: the CLI must not invent a posture (the platform rejects
  defaulted postures by design).
- `statecraft stamp status <jobId> [--watch]` -> GET
  /api/v1/stamps/:jobId; --watch polls (2s interval, backoff to 10s)
  until green|failed, exit 0|1 accordingly, streaming state changes as
  they happen.
- `statecraft fleet list --tenant <id>`; `statecraft fleet deploy
  --tenant <id> --app <fleetApp> --image <ref>`; `statecraft fleet
  update <appId> --image <ref>`; `statecraft fleet backup <appId>`;
  `statecraft fleet remove <appId> --confirm <name>` (the confirm-name
  guard from statecraft spec 006 is surfaced verbatim; no
  --force/--yes shortcut exists, deliberately).
- Human output: aligned tables with the fields a operator scans for
  (ids, names, status, age); JSON output: the platform response passed
  through with a stable envelope {ok, data|error}.

## 3. Acceptance

- Mock-server tests per verb: happy path, api-error surfacing,
  missing-service 404 mapping, watch-mode terminal states; a JSON
  snapshot test per verb locking the envelope.
- Manual e2e against a live plane for whichever services exist at
  implementation time, documented in the commit message.
- ci.yml + spine gates green.

## 4. Out of scope

- Approvals verbs (arrive when the platform's approvals surface
  exists, follow-up to statecraft spec 008).
- MCP exposure (105).
- Any local stamping (stamping is the platform's job; the CLI only
  triggers and watches).
- Local certificate verification: when the signed-cert path lands
  (enrahitu spec 012 §7, born-with certVersion 2), verification is
  repo-local via pinned tenant-tail; the CLI does not wrap it.

## 5. Endpoint map and JSON envelope (2026-07-15 amendment)

§2 named the verbs but left the concrete HTTP mapping, the request
bodies, and the envelope's error arm implicit. This section inlines
them, read off statecraft specs 004 (tenants), 005 (factory), and 006
(fleet) on 2026-07-15. §1's divergence rule still governs: if a live
plane differs, the platform spec wins and this section is re-amended,
never coded around.

### 5.1 Endpoint map (all paths under the plane's `/api/v1`)

| Verb | Method + path | Request body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tenants list` | GET `/tenants` | (none) |
| `tenants show <id>` | GET `/tenants/:id` | (none) |
| `tenants install-url <id>` | GET `/tenants/:id/github/install-url` | (none) |
| `stamp new` | POST `/tenants/:id/stamps` | `{appName, targetOrg, posture, frontend?}` |
| `stamp status <jobId>` | GET `/stamps/:jobId` | (none) |
| `fleet list --tenant <id>` | GET `/tenants/:id/fleet` | (none) |
| `fleet deploy` | POST `/tenants/:id/fleet` | `{name, image}` |
| `fleet update <appId>` | POST `/fleet/:appId/update` | `{image}` |
| `fleet backup <appId>` | POST `/fleet/:appId/backup` | `{}` |
| `fleet remove <appId>` | DELETE `/fleet/:appId` | `{confirm}` |

Every mapping above is verbatim from the platform specs except one:
`fleet list` -> GET `/tenants/:id/fleet`. Statecraft spec 006 defines
the fleet collection's deploy (POST `/tenants/:id/fleet`) and the
per-app status/update/backup/remove, but names no list endpoint. The
CLI inlines the symmetric collection GET as its expectation, mirroring
the factory's `GET /tenants/:id/stamps` list; if the plane lands a
different list shape, §1 governs. `stamp new`'s `posture` is a required
field the caller must supply: the factory rejects a defaulted posture
by design (statecraft spec 005 §3, pipeline step 3), so the CLI makes
`--posture` a required flag with no default and forwards it as
`posture`. `fleet remove`'s `confirm` carries the literal app name the
operator echoes (statecraft spec 006 §3, destructive guard); there is
no `--force`/`--yes` shortcut.

### 5.2 JSON envelope (`--output json`)

Both faces (spec 105 reuses this) consume one stable envelope:

- Success: `{"ok": true, "data": <platform response, passed through
  verbatim>}`. The CLI does not reshape the plane's payload; it wraps
  it, so the envelope stays stable as platform fields grow.
- Failure: `{"ok": false, "error": {"kind": <k>, "message": <m>,
  "status"?: <http status>}}`, where `kind` is one of `network`,
  `unauthenticated`, `api`, `server`, `decode` (the spec 103 taxonomy).
  The envelope is emitted on stdout and the process still exits 1.

In human mode, success renders as an aligned table (ids, names, status,
age); failure prints the taxonomy message to stderr and exits 1 (the
spec 102 exit-code contract). Only the request taxonomy above is
enveloped. A pre-flight failure the CLI detects before any request is
reported plainly (stderr) in both formats, never wrapped: a missing
base URL is usage (exit 2), and a missing stored credential is
operational (exit 1) with the `run login` hint, matching `whoami`.

### 5.3 Response-shape expectations (human rendering only)

The passthrough envelope means `--output json` is faithful to whatever
the plane returns. Human tables need named fields, so the CLI reads a
tolerant subset (unknown fields ignored, absent optional fields blank).
The shapes below were read off the statecraft service code
(`backend/tenants/api.ts`, `backend/factory/api.ts`,
`backend/fleet/api.ts`) and confirmed against a running plane on
2026-07-15; a shape the human renderer cannot read surfaces as a
`decode` error (exit 1), the intended drift signal.

- **List endpoints are wrapped in a named collection key, never a bare
  array.** `tenants list` reads `{tenants:[…]}` (`ListTenantsResponse`)
  and `fleet list` reads `{apps:[…]}` (`ListFleetResponse`); the CLI
  unwraps the key before tabulating.
- **`tenants show` is `{tenant:{…}, installations:[…]}`**
  (`TenantDetailResponse`): the record lives under `tenant`, and
  `installations` is a sibling array, not nested inside the record.
- **Stamp records (`stamp new`, `stamp status`) are a flat
  `StampJobView`** carrying at least `id` and `status` (also `appName`,
  `org`, `certHash`, `error`).
- **Fleet app records (`fleet deploy`/`update`/`remove`) are a flat
  `FleetAppView`** carrying at least `id` and `status` (also `name`,
  `image`, `host`).
- **`fleet backup` is a `BackupResponse` `{repository, tag, jobName}`**,
  a completed-backup receipt with no `id`/`status`; `repository` is the
  required field.

Correction note (2026-07-15, live-verification pass): an earlier draft
of this section assumed bare-array lists, a `tenants show` record with a
nested `installations` array, and a `fleet backup` op record carrying
`id`/`status`. The live e2e (§6) proved all three wrong against the
plane. Per §1 the platform wins, so the shapes above were corrected to
the platform contract and the human renderers re-fitted; the mock tests
that had encoded the wrong shapes were corrected with them. `--output
json` was unaffected throughout (it wraps the plane payload verbatim).

### 5.4 Watch semantics (`stamp status --watch`)

Poll GET `/stamps/:jobId` starting at 2s and backing off toward a 10s
cap, emitting each observed state change (a line in human mode, an
envelope in JSON mode) rather than every poll. A terminal `green`
exits 0; a terminal `failed` exits 1 (the final state is already on
stdout, so no additional stderr line). A transport error mid-poll
aborts through the normal taxonomy after the client's GET retries are
exhausted.

## 6. Status (2026-07-15)

Implemented: the full §2/§5.1 verb surface (tenants list/show/
install-url, stamp new/status with `--watch`, fleet list/deploy/update/
backup/remove) in the new `statecraft_cli::verbs` module over the spec
103 client, which grew GET/POST/DELETE returning a passthrough
`serde_json::Value`. Human output is aligned tables; `--output json`
emits the §5.2 `{ok, data|error}` envelope. The `--posture` guard is
required with no default and the `fleet remove` confirm-name guard is
surfaced verbatim, both per §2. A missing service's 404 surfaces as
"not enabled on this control plane" (exit 1, not a crash) per §1.

Covered by 70 tests (58 unit + 12 integration): per-verb happy path,
api-error surfacing, missing-service 404 mapping, watch-mode terminal
states, and a JSON envelope snapshot per verb family. The release
binary was additionally driven end-to-end against a mock plane: every
verb renders in both formats with the right exit codes, the
non-idempotent DELETE is not retried, and `--debug` never leaks the
token.

Live e2e (2026-07-15, resolves §3): run against a local plane (the
statecraft services stamped and reachable). `login` (bearer handoff),
then every read verb against real data: `tenants list` (table),
`tenants show` (record + installations), `fleet list` (empty), `stamp
status` on a real job, `stamp status --watch` on a terminal `failed`
job (exit 1, §5.4), and `tenants install-url` (real GitHub App URL).
`--output json` verified stable throughout. The governed write is
evidenced by a pre-existing launched stamp job on the plane, read live
above; a fresh self-launch was deliberately not performed (owner
decision) because the factory pipeline creates a real GitHub repo, an
outward-facing side effect beyond the local plane, and the launch path
is already covered by mock tests and by the existing job.

The live run found real shape drift (the CLI's human renderers assumed
shapes the plane never returns) and it was fixed per §1: see the §5.3
correction note. With the reads live-verified and the drift resolved,
§3 acceptance holds; this spec is `implementation: complete`.
