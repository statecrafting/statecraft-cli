summary: >
  The first stage of corpus adoption (010 A-2, D16) and the only one an
  operator can run against any repository with zero commitment: a
  read-only preflight that maps an ungoverned target and produces a
  written proposal, never a change. It detects language, build, and
  test surfaces; extracts a change-coupling map from the target's own
  merge history (files that change together, churn-weighted); and
  proposes candidate spec territories at change level, each with its
  file set and the evidence behind it, with the ungoverned remainder
  explicit. Registering an ungoverned repository stops being a bare
  qualification failure: the verdict gains an "ungoverned, adoptable"
  reading so such targets stay visible with reasons, never scheduled
  for build, and never silently dropped.

# 034: Adoption preflight

## 1. Purpose

Everything downstream of adoption (synthesis, scoring, ratification)
depends on where the territory boundaries fall, and boundaries drawn
from a directory listing are guesses. The target's own merge history is
the one witness of how the code actually cleaves: files that ship
together belong together. The preflight turns that history into a
proposal an operator can read, argue with, and hand to synthesis, while
committing to nothing.

## 2. Territory

`src/orchestrator/adopt/preflight.ts` and its colocated tests: surface
detection, history extraction, the partition proposal, and its
serialization. Extensions as declared in `extends`: the qualification
vocabulary in `projects.ts` and the CLI verb. The build session is
granted authority to record additive D-n notes in specs 025 and 028 for
those mechanical additions, per the coherence guard's explicit-authority
clause; it does not amend their B-level contracts.

## 3. Behavior

- **B-1 (read-only, proposal out).** The preflight writes nothing inside
  the target: no branch, no file, no state root growth beyond the
  journal record of the preflight itself. Its output is one
  deterministic proposal document written to an operator-chosen `--out`
  path (defaulting under the daemon home), carrying every claim with
  its evidence.
- **B-2 (surface detection).** Language, build command, and test
  command are detected from manifest evidence (package.json, Cargo.toml,
  pyproject.toml, Makefile, and peers). A surface the evidence does not
  determine is reported unknown, with the candidates found and why each
  is unconfirmed; the preflight never silently guesses (010 B-4
  extended to cartography).
- **B-3 (change-coupling).** From the last N first-parent merges
  (default 200, bounded by what the clone holds, the shortfall named),
  the preflight extracts per-commit changed path sets and computes
  churn per path and co-change affinity between paths. Vendored,
  generated, and lockfile paths are excluded by a reviewable, exported
  default list; every exclusion is visible in the proposal.
- **B-4 (candidate territories).** The proposal ranks candidate
  territories at change level (010 D16): clusters of paths with high
  internal co-change and a live churn signal, each carrying its file
  set, its churn share, and sample commits as evidence. Paths in no
  candidate are listed as the explicit ungoverned remainder. The
  proposal proposes; it never claims the partition is correct, and its
  wording says which specs 036's replay would score it against.
- **B-5 (adoptable, visibly).** Registering a target that fails
  governed qualification (025 B-4) because it has no corpus now records
  the failure with an `adoptable` reading when the target is otherwise
  sound (git repo, origin remote, resolvable default branch): the
  project stays visible in every surface with its reasons, is never
  schedulable for build work, and `adoptable` is a recorded fact about
  the target, never a consent (arming an adoptable project schedules
  nothing; there is nothing schedulable in it).
- **B-6 (journaled).** Running a preflight against a registered project
  appends a journal record naming the target's HEAD sha, the history
  window actually used, and the proposal's content hash, so a later
  ratification (036) can cite exactly which cartography it trusted.

## 4. Functional requirements

- **FR-001.** Extraction and clustering are pure over (commit list,
  path sets) and tested against fixture histories: a repo with two
  clearly separate subsystems, a repo with one hot subsystem and a cold
  remainder, a shallow history (window shortfall named), and an empty
  history (proposal says so, proposes nothing).
- **FR-002.** Surface detection tests cover a Bun/TypeScript fixture, a
  Cargo fixture, a fixture with both (both reported, neither chosen),
  and a fixture with none (unknown, candidates empty).
- **FR-003.** Proposal serialization is deterministic (constitution:
  same inputs, byte-identical output) and carries evidence for every
  candidate: file set, churn share, sample commits.
- **FR-004.** Qualification tests: an ungoverned-but-sound fixture
  records `adoptable` with reasons; a non-repo still fails plainly; a
  governed repo is untouched by this spec's vocabulary.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1.** `bun test src/orchestrator/adopt/preflight.test.ts` passes.
- **AC-2.** `observatory orchestrator adopt preflight <fixture> --out
  <path>` writes a proposal for an ungoverned fixture repo and prints
  its candidate count, remainder size, and unknowns; running it twice
  produces byte-identical proposals.
- **AC-3.** `observatory orchestrator projects` renders an
  ungoverned-but-sound registered fixture as adoptable with reasons,
  and `dag`/`next` refuse it with the reason named, not an empty
  answer.

## 6. Out of scope

Writing anything into the target (035's synthesis sessions own that,
behind their own consent); replay scoring (036); defect capture rules
(037); semantic code analysis beyond path-level history (an import
graph is a later refinement, named here so its absence is a choice);
API and UI surfaces for adoption (a later spec consumes the CLI's
shapes).

## 7. Resolved decisions

D-1. History extraction walks first-parent merges so the unit of
evidence is the reviewed change (the PR), not the intermediate commit;
a repo whose default branch has no merge commits falls back to plain
first-parent history, and the proposal names which mode it read.

D-2. The exclusion list (vendored, generated, lockfiles) is exported,
reviewable data with tests (031 FR-002's precedent), because a wrong
exclusion silently deletes evidence; the CLI accepts additions, never
removals, of exclusions per run, so the floor is the audited constant.

D-3. Clustering is deterministic greedy agglomeration over co-change
affinity with an exported threshold, not an optimizer: the proposal's
job is a defensible starting point an operator can read, and 036's
replay, not the clustering objective, is the arbiter of whether the
boundaries hold. A fancier partitioner may replace it later without
changing this contract.

D-4 (2026-08-05, the build session). A commit wider than the exported
WIDE_COMMIT_PATH_LIMIT (100 paths) contributes churn but no coupling
evidence: a repo-wide sweep pairs everything with everything and would
weld the whole tree into one territory, and the pair count grows
quadratically besides. Never silent: the proposal names how many
commits this dropped from the affinity computation. Down-weighting wide
commits instead of dropping them is a later refinement.

D-5 (2026-08-05, the build session). The proposal document is
deterministic markdown, and its content hash is sha256 over the
document's exact bytes. Markdown because B-1's artifact is something an
operator reads and argues with; deterministic because nothing in the
renderer reads a clock, so AC-2's byte-identity falls out of the inputs
alone. Later specs consume the exported AdoptionProposal shape from the
module, not a parse of the document.

D-6 (2026-08-05, the build session). B-4's "high internal co-change
and a live churn signal" made concrete: affinity is Jaccard (commits
together over commits touching either) with the exported threshold at
0.5 (they ship together at least as often as apart), and a candidate
territory needs at least MIN_TERRITORY_PATHS (2) files and
MIN_TERRITORY_COMMITS (2) distinct commits. A pair that co-changed once
has perfect affinity and no live signal; it stays in the remainder.

D-7 (2026-08-05, the build session). The CLI verb is offline and
path-addressed (no daemon, no API route), like `journal verify`: the
whole point is running against a repository nothing governs yet. The
B-6 record is appended only when the resolved path is a registered
project's repoDir, into that project's state root, through a writer
handle held for one append; an unregistered target says "nothing
journaled" in the output rather than journaling somewhere uncitable.

D-8 (2026-08-05, the build session). B-5's dag/next refusal is a
refusing DagReader (adoptableDagReader) swapped in at the one place the
CLI composes a project's resources: every structural read against an
adoptable project throws the reason (name, failed checks, the preflight
verb to run), which the served error envelope carries to the operator.
The corpus vocabulary of dag.ts and the API's routes stay untouched,
which is what keeps this spec's territory additive.
