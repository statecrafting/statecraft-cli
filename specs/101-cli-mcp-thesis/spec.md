summary: >
  The successor to OPC (the retired Tauri desktop cockpit): a single
  binary named statecraft that exposes the platform's governance verbs
  twice, as CLI subcommands for humans and as an MCP server for agents.
  The MCP face is the product's genuinely unique surface: any agent
  (Claude Code first) operates natively under Statecraft governance,
  requesting approvals, checking spec-code coupling, and triggering
  factory stages. This is milestone M4 in the Statecraft ladder; the spec
  records the thesis and the decided constraints so the repo is born
  governed ahead of its build.

# 101: statecraft-cli thesis

## 1. Purpose

OPC (the Open Agentic Platform's Tauri + React desktop cockpit) had thin
value over the platform API as a windowed app; its real asset was where it
ran: on the developer's machine, next to the code and the agents. This
repo rebuilds that asset in its natural shape: one binary, two faces.

- **CLI face** (humans): governance verbs as subcommands: authenticate
  against a Statecraft control plane, inspect tenants and fleets, request
  and grant approvals, check coupling status, trigger and watch factory
  stages.
- **MCP face** (agents): the same verbs exposed as MCP tools over stdio,
  so a coding agent operates under Statecraft governance natively instead
  of shelling out around it. Claude Code is the first target client.

Both faces call the same control-plane API with the same identity model;
the MCP face is not a privileged side door.

## 2. Decided constraints

- **Binary name `statecraft`.** The OPC name retires with the desktop
  app; brew/cargo naming is uncontested. Distribution was originally
  assumed to be npm (published as `statecraft-cli`, the bare npm name
  being taken), and the repo keeps that name. Spec 107 superseded the
  npm assumption: `statecraft` is a single-binary product, not a
  library, so it ships as tag-gated prebuilt binaries plus an
  `install.sh` (curl | sh), with no registry publishing. 107 is the
  decided distribution channel; the npm line here was a 2026-07-14
  assumption that did not survive the build.
- **Implementation language: Rust** (single static binary, no runtime
  dependency on the customer machine; the MCP server speaks stdio).
- **License Apache-2.0.** The CLI is the funnel and the agent bridge;
  AGPL binaries in corporate dev loops cost adoption for zero protective
  benefit. The AGPL boundary stays at the control plane.
- **No TUI** until demand proves it; the web governance UI absorbs
  graphical needs.

## 3. Territory

`README.md` now; the crate and its manifests when the build starts (M4 in
the Statecraft milestone ladder; see statecraft spec 001 §6). Verb
inventory and API surface graduate into their own numbered specs at that
point, informed by the OPC governance-verb inventory
(knowledge://open-agentic-platform/product/apps/opc).

## 4. Out of scope

- Control-plane behavior (statecraft repo).
- Template mechanics (enrahitu repo).
- A desktop or graphical client of any kind.

## 5. Status (2026-07-23)

Complete. The thesis and its decided constraints are realized by the
build backlog: the crate scaffold (102), auth + API client (103), the
governance verbs (104), the stdio MCP face (105), and the template
upgrade verb (106), with distribution settled by 107. Every §2
constraint holds: binary name `statecraft`, Rust single binary, stdio
MCP, Apache-2.0, no TUI. The one §2 assumption that did not survive was
npm distribution, superseded by 107's tag-gated binaries + `install.sh`
(no registry publishing); §2 is amended to record that. The territory
this spec establishes (`README.md`) exists and is consistent with 107.
