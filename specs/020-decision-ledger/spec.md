summary: >
  The coherence mechanism across sessions: an append-only, hash-linked
  ledger of decisions made where a spec was silent, written during sessions
  through a validated drop-box, sealed by the orchestrator at stage end,
  and injected into future sessions whose spec or dependencies match the
  decision's scope. Decisions are never edited; they are superseded by
  later decisions that name them.

# 020: Decision ledger

## 1. Purpose

Spec 40 stays coherent with spec 8 only if the choices spec 8's builder made
are visible to spec 40's builder. The ledger is that memory, with the same
integrity guarantees as the work journal.

## 2. Territory

`src/orchestrator/decisions.ts` and tests. Storage:
`data/orchestrator/decisions.jsonl` (chain, spec 011 envelope) and
`data/orchestrator/decision-dropbox/` (session-writable staging).

## 3. Behavior

- **B-1 (record shape).** `{id, specId, scope, title, decision, rationale,
  alternatives?, supersedes?}` where scope is a list of spec ids and/or
  path prefixes the decision touches. Payloads follow the journal's
  no-float rule.
- **B-2 (chain).** Same envelope, durability, and verification as spec 011
  (shared implementation, second chain). Append-only; supersession is a new
  record naming the old id.
- **B-3 (drop-box).** Sessions cannot append to the chain directly (the
  daemon holds the writer lock). The build/ship/shepherd prompts instruct
  sessions to write one JSON file per decision into the drop-box; at stage
  end the orchestrator validates each against the schema, seals valid ones
  into the chain (journaling the sealing), and surfaces invalid ones as
  stage warnings with the file preserved.
- **B-4 (injection).** `decisionsFor(specId)` selects records whose scope
  intersects the spec, its `depends_on` closure, or its territory paths,
  newest-first, superseded records resolved away, bounded to a prompt
  budget with the overflow count stated in the prompt (never silent
  truncation).
- **B-5 (browsing).** The ledger is queryable (by spec, by path, full-text)
  through the HTTP API (spec 022) for the UI's searchable browser.

## 4. Functional requirements

- **FR-001.** Schema validation rejects: missing fields, unknown fields,
  floats, scope entries that are neither known spec ids nor plausible repo
  paths.
- **FR-002.** Injection tests cover scope intersection via dependency
  closure and supersession shadowing.
- **FR-003.** The drop-box is emptied only after successful sealing;
  a crash between validate and seal re-validates idempotently (dedup by
  content hash).

## 5. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1.** `bun test src/orchestrator/decisions.test.ts` passes.
- **AC-2.** A fixture flow (session writes two decisions, one malformed)
  seals one, warns on one, and a later `decisionsFor` on a downstream spec
  returns the sealed decision.

## 6. Out of scope

Editing or deleting decisions, human decision authoring UI (the API accepts
operator-authored decisions through the same validated path), and
cross-repo ledgers.

## 7. Resolved decisions

D-1. B-2 says "shared implementation, second chain", but `journal.ts`
hardcoded its four filenames (`journal.jsonl`, `anchor.json`,
`journal.jsonl.torn`, `journal.lock`) inside `openJournal`. Resolved:
`openJournal`/`verifyChain` take an optional `basename` parameter; omitting
it reproduces the exact filenames every existing caller already depends on,
and a caller-chosen basename (`openDecisionsChain` uses `"decisions"`)
derives an analogous, non-colliding set (`decisions.jsonl`,
`decisions.anchor.json`, `decisions.jsonl.torn`, `decisions.lock`) in the
same directory. One sentence was added to spec 011's own body (section 2)
naming this reuse, so the two specs stay coupled to the one shared
implementation rather than the change looking like an undocumented
side-effect of building this one.

D-2. FR-003 requires dedup "by content hash" without defining what is
hashed. Resolved: `contentHashOf(record)` = sha256 over the canonical
(key-sorted) JSON of exactly the `DecisionRecord`'s own B-1 fields (`id`,
`specId`, `scope`, `title`, `decision`, `rationale`, and
`alternatives`/`supersedes` when present), the same bytes stored as the
`decision.sealed` chain payload; never the journal envelope (`seq`, `ts`,
`prevHash`, `recordHash`), which necessarily differs per append attempt.
A drop-box file re-processed after a crash between the chain append (already
fsynced, durable) and the unlink hashes identically to the record already
sealed, so the re-run recognizes it as already-sealed, unlinks it, and does
not append a duplicate.

D-3. B-1 lists `alternatives?` with no shape. Resolved:
`alternatives?: readonly string[]`, one entry per alternative considered and
rejected, matching the plural noun and `scope`'s own list precedent (a
single free-text field would have to enumerate options inside prose).

D-4. `decisionsFor` takes `records` directly (not a `JournalHandle` or
`FoldedState`), so it needs a defined ordering contract to compute
"newest-first" without a `seq` field on `DecisionRecord` itself. Resolved:
`records` is documented and expected in chain (append) order, oldest first,
exactly what `decisionRecordsFromChain(chain.fold())` returns;
`decisionsFor` and `queryDecisions` each reverse it internally.

D-5. B-4's "bounded to a prompt budget" does not define what is measured.
Resolved: `budgetChars` measures the `stableStringify` length of each
record's chain payload (the same canonical JSON `contentHashOf` hashes), a
deterministic stand-in for prompt characters that needs no tokenizer
dependency (the zero-runtime-dependency convention).

D-6. B-3 says an invalid drop-box file is surfaced as a stage warning "with
the file preserved", without saying where. Preserved in place, it is re-read,
re-rejected and re-reported by every later sweep in the same project,
without bound and with no path to resolution: found live on butler-ai, where
eight files rejected on 2026-09-01 were still being re-reported in every
build two days later, and the sweep's report had become a growing list of
the project's whole rejection history rather than an account of this sweep.
Resolved: preserved means moved into a quarantine subdirectory of the
drop-box (`invalid/`, `QUARANTINE_DIRNAME`), created lazily so a project
that never writes a bad record never grows an empty directory. B-3's
substance is kept, since nothing the session wrote is deleted and an
operator can repair a file and move it back, while each sweep reports only
what it found. The drop-box is one directory shared by every spec and every
attempt, and the prompt fixes the record id rather than the filename, so a
basename can arrive twice; the second one takes the first free numeric
suffix rather than replacing the file already there, since a rename that
overwrites is the deletion this decision undertakes not to do. The
`decision.sealed.outcome` record names `quarantineDir` when, and only when,
something was quarantined, so the record points at the files without
asserting a directory that was never created.

D-7. B-1 marks `alternatives` and `supersedes` optional without saying how a
writer spells "not used". The validator accepted only an absent key, so an
explicit `null` was read as a present-but-malformed value and rejected the
whole record. Found live on butler-ai: three 009 decisions, among them the
two that had correctly diagnosed an unresolvable coupling violation, were
discarded over `"supersedes": null`. Resolved: on an optional field, null
reads as absent. FR-001's rejection classes are missing fields, unknown
fields, floats and bad scope entries; this was never one of them, and the
strictness bought nothing while costing whole records for an encoding choice
that loses no meaning. Null is normalized away at construction rather than
carried, so it can never reach the canonical payload that `contentHashOf`
hashes; a present, non-null value of the wrong type is still rejected as
before. The build prompt states the convention as well, since a session that
omits the key is clearer than one that nulls it.
