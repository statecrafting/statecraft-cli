summary: >
  A read-mostly single-page app served same-origin by the daemon (built
  assets embedded, statecraft pattern): DAG view with status, readiness,
  blockers, and invalidation; live run view with current spec, stage, and
  streaming session output over SSE; quota state with time-to-reset
  (estimates marked); searchable decision-ledger browser; run history with
  the per-spec evidence trail (PR, CI result, verify verdict, costs); and
  the control verbs the API exposes, each with a confirmation that names
  what will be journaled. It is an observability surface, not a wizard:
  every number on screen is traceable to a journal record or an evidence
  file.

# 024: Localhost web UI

## 1. Purpose

The at-a-glance answer to "what is it doing, why, and can I trust it",
without ssh-ing into a terminal. Honesty over polish.

## 2. Territory

`web/` (Vite + React SPA, no server-side code) and
`src/orchestrator/api/static.ts` (same-origin static serving of the built
assets by the daemon). One additive touch outside that territory:
`src/orchestrator/api/server.ts` (spec 022) gains the `staticDir` dep and
the fall-through that hands non-`/api` paths to the static handler.

## 3. Behavior

- **B-1 (serving).** The daemon serves the built SPA at `/`; the SPA talks
  only to the same-origin API and SSE stream. No external network requests
  (fonts, CDNs, telemetry: none).
- **B-2 (DAG view).** Nodes show spec id, title, lifecycle +
  implementation, readiness or the blocker list verbatim from the selected
  project's `dag` route (`/api/dag` in v1, `/api/projects/<name>/dag`
  since 027 B-3), pin drift (invalidation) prominently. Edges are
  `depends_on`.
- **B-3 (live run).** Current spec, stage, attempt, elapsed, and a
  scrollback-bounded live tail of session events from SSE; disconnects
  reconnect with `Last-Event-ID` replay. On a v2 daemon one stream carries
  every project, and the tail renders the selected one's events (029 B-5).
- **B-4 (quota).** Parked state shows the countdown target, the estimated
  flag when the horizon is inferred, and consecutive-park warnings. The
  pool is the account's rather than any project's (027 B-4), so v2 also
  renders it once in the global banner (029 B-4).
- **B-5 (decisions and history).** Ledger browser with query passthrough
  to the selected project's `decisions` route (`/api/decisions` in v1,
  `/api/projects/<name>/decisions` since 027 B-3); history lists spec
  executions with links to PR, CI run, verify verdict, and evidence files
  served from that project's `evidence` route (`/api/evidence/` in v1,
  `/api/projects/<name>/evidence/` since 027).
- **B-6 (controls).** Start, pause, resume, skip, retry stage, re-run
  verify, force human gate, approve, each addressing the selected
  project's scoped routes in v2. Each control shows the exact control
  record that will be journaled before confirming; 029 B-3 puts the same
  pattern over the registry verbs, which address the daemon's projects
  chain rather than a run. Controls are the only writes; everything else
  is read-only.
- **B-7 (read-mostly and honest).** No optimistic UI: state changes render
  only after the SSE event or a refetch confirms them. Unknowns render as
  unknown, never as spinners that imply progress.

## 4. Functional requirements

- **FR-001.** The SPA builds with `bun run web:build` into assets the
  daemon embeds/serves; CI builds it.
- **FR-002.** Component tests cover the DAG readiness rendering and the
  control confirmation flow against a fixture API.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1.** With the fixture daemon running, the five views render real
  journal-derived data end to end.
- **AC-2.** Killing the daemon mid-view degrades to an explicit
  "daemon unreachable" state, not a stale-but-live-looking dashboard.

## 6. Out of scope

Authentication and remote access (spec 022 B-1 governs), historical
analytics/charts beyond the history list, and any spec-editing capability
(specs are authored in the repo, reviewed as code).

## 7. Resolved decisions

D-1 (2026-08-03, operator). The Verification section gains the browser
half it was always meant to carry, deferred until standby (spec 026)
made the daemon reachable outside a live run: two `verify:browser`
assertions against the served dashboard, exercising spec 019 B-3's
Claude-in-Chrome path for real instead of only through its fake. This
amendment deliberately drifts this spec's pin; the requalification it
forces (021 D-18) is the demonstration: re-verification now includes
the browser assertions, so "the dashboard renders honestly" is checked
by a browser, not asserted by prose. The assertions name only stable
surfaces (the project list and the switcher), not counts or specific
project names beyond the self-hosted one, so they hold in any
deployment with at least the bootstrap registration.

## Verification

```verify:cli
bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun run web:build
```

```verify:browser
url: http://127.0.0.1:4519
The page shows a standby or run view for a project named claude-observatory, with a chip or label indicating whether it is armed or disarmed.
The header carries a project switcher control that lists at least one project name, and the daemon state (such as standby or driving) is visible somewhere on the page.
```
