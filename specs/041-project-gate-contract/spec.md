summary: >
  The post-session gate a driven target is judged by is hardcoded to this
  repo's conventions: four spec-spine commands plus `bun run typecheck`
  and `bun test`, with the Bun pair dropped whenever the target has no
  root tsconfig.json (016 D-10). A Rust target therefore passes the build
  stage on governance alone; cargo correctness reaches the pipeline only
  through whatever the session ran for itself and through CI in the
  shepherd stage. With two Rust targets about to be armed (rahi, then
  aicortex and hqgit on top of it), that gap is a claim the orchestrator
  makes without evidence. This spec makes the language gate per-project
  registry state, like the execution profile: a journaled gate contract
  (an ordered command list run after the universal spec-spine four),
  folded from the projects chain, probed to a default at registration
  (a `make ci` target if the repo declares one, else the lint-and-test
  gate for TypeScript, Rust, Go or a Python project's declared tools,
  else governance-only), derived into the stage's gate suite by one pure
  function every stage uses, and displayed wherever the project is named.
  Projects registered before this spec are migrated by the same probe on
  first service, so the window in which they would fold to
  governance-only closes itself.

# 041: Project gate contract

## 1. Purpose

Spec 016 B-5 says the build stage passes only when the gate commands exit 0
on the branch after the session ends, and that the session saying "done" is
not evidence. That sentence is only as strong as the command list behind it.
Today that list is this repo's: the four spec-spine commands and two Bun
commands, and 016 D-10 drops the Bun pair on any target without a root
tsconfig.json. For a Rust workspace the orchestrator's post-session verdict
is therefore "governance green", which says nothing about whether the crate
compiles or its tests pass. The first driven family repo (tenant-tail) found
this; rahi records it as its spec 001 D-1 and works around it by having the
session run `make ci` itself, which is precisely the self-authored evidence
016 exists to refuse.

The fix follows 032 exactly. The execution profile made session posture a
chosen, journaled, displayed fact instead of a hardcoded flag. This spec does
the same for the language gate: what commands a target is judged by is a
registry record, derived into the stage by one pure function, and visible
on every surface that names the project.

## 2. Territory

Owned: `src/orchestrator/gate-contract.ts` (the contract type, the
registration-time probe, the one derivation) and its tests. Extended, each
additively unless marked: the projects chain (a new record kind and fold
field), the build stage (the derivation replaces `gateCommandsFor`; the
exported `GATE_COMMANDS` constant remains as the universal floor), the
shepherd stage (remediation prompt lists the project's gate), the daemon
(threads the contract into each stage, and appends the B-8 migration
record for a project that has none), and the CLI and API project
surfaces (render it).

Not claimed: the verify stage's `verify:cli` blocks (019), which are per-spec
assertions, not the per-project gate; the execution profile (032); CI
workflow content inside any target.

## 3. Behavior

- **B-1 (model).** A gate contract is `{commands: string[][], source:
  "probe" | "cli" | "api" | "ui"}`. `commands` is an ordered list of argv
  arrays run in the target's root after the universal governance floor
  (the four `spec-spine` entries of `GATE_COMMANDS`), each required to
  exit 0. An empty list is a legal contract meaning governance-only and
  is displayed as such; it is never the silent default for a target that
  has a language gate to run.
- **B-2 (probe at registration).** Registration appends a
  `project.gate.set` record whose commands come from a read-only probe of
  the target. The rules are tried in order and the first match wins:

  | # | evidence in the target root | commands |
  |---|---|---|
  | 1 | `Makefile` with a `ci` target | `make ci` |
  | 2 | `tsconfig.json` | `bun run typecheck`, `bun test` |
  | 3 | `Cargo.toml` | `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace --locked` |
  | 4 | `go.mod` | `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `go test ./...` |
  | 5 | `pyproject.toml` | the declared tools only, per D-4 |
  | 6 | none of the above | the empty list |

  Rules 3 and 4 name a full lint-and-test gate rather than tests alone,
  because `cargo` and `go` are the toolchain: a repo that has one has
  those subcommands, and formatting and lint failures are gate failures
  in this family's own practice (D-3). Rule 5 is narrower on purpose:
  Python's toolchain is not implied by `pyproject.toml`, so the probe
  reads what the file declares rather than guessing (D-4). The probe's
  verdict and which rule fired are part of the record, so a registration
  whose gate is governance-only says why. Requalification (025) re-runs
  the probe and appends a new record only when the derived commands
  differ from the current fold.
- **B-3 (chain, not table).** The contract is folded from the projects
  chain exactly as `profile` is (032 B-2). A chain with no gate record
  folds to the empty list flagged `legacy: true`. This is weaker than
  016 D-10's live probe, which reads the tree on every stage run: a
  project registered before this spec has no gate record and no
  `hasTsconfig` on its registration record to reconstruct one from, so
  the honest fold is governance-only and every surface says `legacy`.
  The fold does not close that window, because a fold may not touch the
  filesystem (D-2); B-8 closes it by writing the missing record.
  Registrations made after this spec never enter the legacy state at
  all, since B-2 gives them a record at birth.
- **B-4 (one derivation).** `gateSuiteFor(contract)` in `gate-contract.ts`
  is a pure function returning the floor followed by the contract's
  commands, and is the only source of the stage gate list. `build.ts`'s
  preflight "gate green at base" (016 B-1), its post-session evidence
  (016 B-5), and shepherd's remediation prompt all consume its output; no
  caller composes a gate list by hand and `gateCommandsFor(runner)` is
  removed.
- **B-5 (journaled evidence).** The stage intent record carries the
  contract the stage was judged under (commands verbatim, source, legacy
  flag). Each command's exit code and bounded output are journaled as
  today (016 B-5); what list produced them is thereafter a journal fact.
- **B-6 (visible gate).** The gate appears wherever the project does: the
  `projects` list line (compact: `make ci`, `bun`, `cargo`, or
  `governance-only`), the project detail view, the API project payload,
  and the registration output. A legacy-derived gate renders
  distinguishably from a probed or operator-set one.
- **B-7 (operator override).** `projects gate <name> -- <argv>...` (CLI)
  and the matching API verb append a `project.gate.set` record with
  source `cli` or `api`. An override that would drop a command the probe
  found is allowed and journaled; the orchestrator records the choice, it
  does not second-guess it.
- **B-8 (migration).** The first time the daemon services a project whose
  chain holds no gate record, it runs the B-2 probe against that
  project's tree and appends a `project.gate.set` record with source
  `probe`, before any stage of that project's run is scheduled. The
  probe runs at write time, so the fold stays a pure function of the
  chain and D-2 is untouched; the record's existence is the idempotence
  guard, so the migration happens once per project and never again; and
  no operator action is required, so the legacy state is a window that
  closes itself rather than a backlog item. A project that genuinely has
  no language gate migrates to an explicit empty contract, which is the
  difference between "nothing to run" and "never asked".

## 4. Functional requirements

- **FR-001.** Fold tests cover: no gate record (legacy empty), a probed
  record, an operator override, a requalification that changes the probe,
  a migration record appended by B-8, and interleaving with profile and
  arm records; chain verification passes over every fixture history.
- **FR-002.** Probe tests run against fixture directories, one per B-2
  rule plus the precedence cases: a Makefile with a `ci` target, a
  Makefile without one beside a tsconfig.json, a Cargo-only workspace, a
  Go module, a `pyproject.toml` declaring ruff and pytest, a
  `pyproject.toml` declaring neither, a target matching two rules at once
  (the earlier wins), and an empty directory. Each yields the B-2
  commands verbatim and names the rule that fired.
- **FR-003.** Derivation tests: the suite always begins with the four
  spec-spine floor commands in `GATE_COMMANDS` order; a contract's
  commands follow verbatim; an empty contract yields exactly the floor.
- **FR-004.** A stage test drives the build stage's preflight and
  post-session gate through a fixture Runner recording the commands it
  was asked to run, under a `make ci` contract, and asserts `make ci`
  ran in both places; the same fixture under a legacy empty contract runs
  exactly today's spec-spine-only list.
- **FR-005.** Surface tests: CLI list and detail render the gate (legacy
  marked), and the API project payload carries the contract.
- **FR-006.** Migration tests: a fixture project whose chain holds no gate
  record gains exactly one `project.gate.set` record with source `probe`
  on first service, matching what B-2 would have derived at registration;
  a second service appends nothing; and a project whose probe finds
  nothing migrates to an explicit empty contract that is no longer marked
  legacy. The migration record is appended before the run's first stage
  is scheduled.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1.** `bun test src/orchestrator/gate-contract.test.ts` passes.
- **AC-2.** The FR-004 stage assertions pass inside the existing build
  stage fixture world.
- **AC-3.** `observatory orchestrator projects` renders a gate for every
  project, including `governance-only (legacy)` for a chain with no gate
  record.
- **AC-4.** `grep -n gateCommandsFor src/` finds no production call site.
- **AC-5.** On this machine's own registry, after every registered
  project has been serviced once under B-8, no project reads `legacy`;
  `claude-observatory` reads the Bun pair it is gated by today, and
  `rahi` reads `make ci`. This is the acceptance test for the migration
  actually restoring what 016 D-10's live probe was providing, rather
  than for the fold in isolation.

## Verification

```verify:cli
bun test src/orchestrator/gate-contract.test.ts
```

```verify:cli
bun test src/orchestrator/stages/build.test.ts
```

```verify:cli
test -z "$(grep -rn 'gateCommandsFor' src --include='*.ts' | grep -v '\.test\.ts')"
```

## 6. Out of scope

Running the gate inside a container or with a resource ceiling (033 owns
economics, 032 owns posture); per-spec gate overrides; treating a target's
CI as the gate (shepherd already watches it; this spec makes the local
verdict honest, it does not replace CI); parsing `make` or `cargo` output
beyond exit codes; and any change to the universal spec-spine floor, which
stays 016's.

The dashboard is also out. B-6's surfaces are the CLI and the API, which is
what FR-005 and AC-3 pin; the web project views keep rendering what they
render today, and the two `web/test/` edges above exist only so the served
payload's new field does not break the dashboard's typecheck. Rendering the
gate in the UI is a later spec's, the way 030 left its panel to 038.

## 7. Resolved decisions

D-1. `make ci` outranks every language rule. A repo that publishes a `ci`
target has stated its gate in one place for humans, CI, and the
orchestrator alike; guessing a language command under it would create a
second, weaker definition of green. The language rules exist for targets
that have not written that target yet.

D-2. The legacy fold does not re-probe the tree. Folding is a pure function
over the chain (025), and reaching into the filesystem during a fold would
make the same history fold differently on two machines. This is why the
legacy fold is honestly empty rather than reconstructed: an earlier draft
of this spec had the registration record carry a `hasTsconfig` boolean so
the fold could rebuild 016 D-10's answer, but that only ever helps
registrations made after this spec, which are exactly the ones that already
get a real record from B-2. For the pre-041 registrations it was meant to
serve it reconstructs nothing, so it was removed in favor of B-8.

D-3 (operator, 2026-09-03). The Rust and Go rules are a full lint-and-test
gate, not tests alone. `cargo` and `go` are the toolchain rather than a
package choice, so `fmt`, `clippy` and `vet` are present wherever the
manifest is, and this family already treats them as gate conditions: the
spec-spine corpus is verified with `cargo test --workspace --locked`,
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` and `cargo fmt
--all --check` on every change. A generous guess is affordable here
because a wrong one is caught before it can drive anything: 016 B-1
already refuses to start a build when the gate is not green at the base
commit, so a probed command that fails on a clean tree surfaces as a
named refusal with the failing command in it, and B-7 is the operator's
one-line correction. That is the same failure 016 D-10 hit live with
`bun run typecheck` on tenant-tail, but recorded and attributable instead
of hardcoded. The narrower alternative, probing tests only, was rejected
because it would have the orchestrator certify as green a target whose
formatter and linter it never ran, which is the same "claim without
evidence" this spec exists to remove.

D-4 (operator, 2026-09-03). Python is probed by declaration, not by
inference. Unlike `cargo` and `go`, `pyproject.toml` implies no test
runner and no linter: the file is a packaging manifest that may be served
by pytest, unittest, nox or tox, and by ruff, flake8, black or nothing.
Guessing `pytest` where it is not installed is exit 127, which is
indistinguishable at the gate from a real failure. So rule 5 reads the
declared tool tables and emits only what the target itself names: a
`[tool.ruff]` table yields `ruff check .`, a `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`
table yields `pytest`, and a `pyproject.toml` declaring neither yields
the empty list with the rule recorded, so the surfaces say "python, no
declared gate" rather than "governance-only" with no reason. This keeps
D-1's principle intact one level down: use what the repo has stated
about itself, and never invent a definition of green on its behalf.
