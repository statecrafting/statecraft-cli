summary: >
  The quota scheduler protects a subscription window; nothing protects a
  balance. Economics (030) computes what a run cost and nothing reads
  it: an oscillating remediation loop on a genuinely broken spec has no
  financial floor. This spec adds per-project cost ceilings as registry
  state (a per-run limit, a per-UTC-day limit, or both), evaluated at
  session spawn boundaries from the journal's own cost records. A
  crossed per-day ceiling parks the run to the next UTC midnight with
  the same journaled-target, jittered-resume mechanics as a quota park;
  a crossed per-run ceiling pauses the run for an operator, since no
  clock makes a run cheaper. Enforcement sums only journaled costs: the
  known-cost floor, with the unknown-session count carried alongside it
  in every record and rendering, never an estimate.

# 033: Cost ceiling

## 1. Purpose

"Leave it running overnight" is a financial statement. The orchestrator
already journals per-session cost (014) and can fold it (030); what is
missing is the enforcement that turns the fold into a floor an operator
can stand on. The design deliberately reuses the parking shape the
operator already knows from quota: a journaled reason, a visible target
or a visible need for a human, and a resume that is either the clock or
an operator record, never a silent retry.

## 2. Territory

`src/orchestrator/budget.ts` and its colocated tests: the ceiling model,
the spend evaluation over journal records, and the park/pause planning.
Extensions as declared in `extends`: the record kind and fold field in
`projects.ts`, the reason vocabulary in `state.ts`, the boundary check in
`daemon.ts`, and the verb plus rendering in the CLI and API surfaces.
The build session is granted authority to record additive D-n notes in
specs 025, 013, 021, 027, and 028 for those mechanical additions, per
the coherence guard's explicit-authority clause; it does not amend their
B-level contracts.

## 3. Behavior

- **B-1 (model).** A ceiling is `{perRunMicroUsd?, perDayMicroUsd?}`,
  either or both; a project without a ceiling record has no ceiling and
  is driven exactly as today. Setting or clearing the ceiling appends a
  registry record (new kind, `project.ceiling.set`) with its source,
  folded like `armed` (025 B-2).
- **B-2 (evaluation, boundaries only).** Before every session spawn the
  daemon evaluates the project's spend from journal records: the current
  run's summed `costMicroUsd` against `perRunMicroUsd`, and the summed
  `costMicroUsd` of sessions whose result was journaled in the current
  UTC calendar day (across runs and specs of that project) against
  `perDayMicroUsd`. Sessions are never killed mid-flight for budget:
  overshoot is bounded by one session, and that bound is stated in the
  journal record when a ceiling trips.
- **B-3 (per-day trip parks).** Crossing `perDayMicroUsd` parks the run
  with reason `budget-day` and target next UTC midnight: a known
  horizon, never an estimate. Resume mechanics are 015 B-3's (jittered,
  journaled target, countdown derived not stored); on resume the
  interrupted stage retries as a fresh attempt. FR-002 recovery applies
  unchanged: a daemon restart while budget-parked resumes the countdown
  from the journaled target.
- **B-4 (per-run trip pauses).** Crossing `perRunMicroUsd` pauses the
  run with reason `budget-run` and `needsHuman`: no clock makes the run
  cheaper, so auto-resume would be a spend loop with extra steps. The
  release is an operator act: raising or clearing the ceiling, or an
  explicit retry/skip verb, each already a journaled record.
- **B-5 (the floor, not an estimate).** Spend sums only journaled
  `costMicroUsd` values (030 B-2's stance): the known-cost floor. Every
  trip record, status line, and API payload carries the floor together
  with that scope's `costUnknownSessions` count, rendered as "at least
  X, N sessions unknown" whenever N is nonzero. A project that has a
  ceiling and a nonzero unknown count in the evaluated scope surfaces a
  health warning: unknowns make the floor porous, and the operator
  should know the ceiling is enforcing less than it appears to.
- **B-6 (budget parks are per-project).** Unlike quota (026 B-5: one
  account pool, global park), a ceiling is a per-project setting: a
  budget-parked or budget-paused project releases the flight slot and
  other projects proceed. Global daemon-wide ceilings are out of scope,
  named below.
- **B-7 (visible everywhere).** The ceiling and current evaluated spend
  appear in the project detail view, the economics CLI rendering, and
  the API project payload; a tripped ceiling names itself on the
  projects list line the same way a quota park does today.

## 4. Functional requirements

- **FR-001.** Spend evaluation is pure over (records, ceiling, now) and
  tested: no ceiling, under, exactly at (at is not over: driving stops
  strictly above), over per-run, over per-day, unknown-cost sessions
  counted and excluded from sums, and the UTC day boundary (a session
  journaled 23:59 counts to its day; 00:01 to the next).
- **FR-002.** Park/pause planning tests: per-day trip plans a park to
  next UTC midnight; per-run trip plans a needsHuman pause; both carry
  floor, unknown count, ceiling, and the one-session overshoot bound in
  the journaled payload.
- **FR-003.** A daemon fixture test drives a project across a ceiling
  (fake sessions with journaled costs) and asserts: the boundary check
  trips before the next spawn, the journal carries the trip record, the
  run state matches B-3/B-4, and a restart while parked recovers the
  countdown from the journaled target.
- **FR-004.** Surface tests: detail and economics renderings show
  ceiling and floor spend with unknowns named; the API payload carries
  them; a project without a ceiling renders "no ceiling", never a blank
  or a zero.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1.** `bun test src/orchestrator/budget.test.ts` passes.
- **AC-2.** The FR-003 scenario passes inside the existing daemon
  fixture world, including the restart-while-parked recovery.
- **AC-3.** `observatory orchestrator projects` and the economics verb
  render ceiling state for a fixture project with a ceiling set, a
  tripped ceiling, and no ceiling.

## 6. Out of scope

Global (cross-project or daemon-wide) ceilings, cost estimation or
projection, mid-session termination on budget, per-spec or per-stage
budgets, currency handling beyond micro-USD, subscription quota
semantics (015 owns them; a quota park and a budget park may coexist,
and the later horizon simply governs the next spawn), and any change to
030's fold: budget evaluation reads the same journal records economics
does but plans enforcement, which stays outside economics per 030's own
scope line.

## 7. Resolved decisions

D-1. Enforcement sums the known-cost floor only, never an estimate.
Estimating unknown sessions would either fabricate spend to stop runs
early or fabricate headroom to keep them going; both punish or permit on
fiction. The porous-floor health warning (B-5) is the honest complement:
visibility of what enforcement cannot see, instead of a number it made
up.

D-2. Checks run at spawn boundaries only. Killing a session mid-flight
to save money wastes the money the session already spent and yields a
severed stage that retries, spending again; the boundary check plus the
stated one-session overshoot bound is both cheaper and honest about its
own precision.

D-3. The per-day window is the UTC calendar day, matching the corpus
rule that all times are UTC internally and display is the client's
concern (015 FR-001). Midnight UTC as the park target is exact
knowledge, so a budget-day park never renders as an estimate.

D-4 (build session). Budget events ride the work journal as their own
kinds (`budget.paused`, `budget.parked`) with machine-readable payloads
(scope, limit, floor, known and unknown session counts, the one-session
overshoot bound, and the target for a day park), appended beside the
run's own pause-reason record, so a surface can tell a budget stop from
a failed stage without parsing prose. All surfaces read one shared
shape (`ProjectBudgetView`) rather than each folding the journal their
own way, and a project whose journal cannot be read reports
`spendError` beside a still-knowable ceiling instead of a zero that
would read as "nothing spent".

D-5 (build session). The write surfaces take the whole ceiling, never a
patch, and clearing is an explicit null-ceiling record the chain
carries rather than an absence the fold infers. The CLI takes dollars
as typed and refuses a value finer than one micro-USD instead of
rounding it silently; `none` clears, and `none` combined with a limit
flag is a usage error refused before the chain moves.

D-6 (operator, 2026-08-05). The interplay B-4 left implicit, pinned by
FR-003's fixture: the retry-exhaustion pause and the ceiling pause are
both legitimate stops at the same boundary, and whichever condition
trips first governs. With the default stage retry budget of 1, two
failed attempts exhaust retries before a third spawn boundary is ever
reached, so the fixture that pins the ceiling's own behavior must
raise the retry budget; that ordering is deliberate, not a defect: a
run out of retries needs a human regardless of what it spent.

D-7 (operator, 2026-08-05). Provenance: build attempt 1 consumed two
sessions, both terminated `max-turns` (journaled, 17.89 USD combined),
attempt 2 refused on the dead session's dirty tree: the same pattern
032's build hit, confirming its D-8 note that the session turn budget
is too small for spec-sized territory. The operator completed the
build from the session's own work, per the 031 D-1 precedent: the
FR-003 fixture's retry budget (D-6) and the FR-004 surface tests were
the only additions; everything else is the session's.
