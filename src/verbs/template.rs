//! The `template upgrade` verb (spec 106): the one local governed verb.
//!
//! Every other verb (tenants/stamp/fleet) is a thin wrapper over the
//! control-plane API. This one never touches the plane. It runs in a stamped
//! app checkout and orchestrates a chassis upgrade end to end: read
//! `template.toml`, bump the chassis package pins in `package.json`, refresh the
//! lockfile, run any template-owned codemods, run the contract's verify verb,
//! and commit on a branch. The CLI orchestrates; all structure knowledge stays
//! in the template and its packages (spec 106 summary). This is the boundary
//! that keeps the CLI from ever becoming a build daemon.
//!
//! Design notes (recorded in spec 106 §2 / §5 for the coherence guard):
//! - Per-package resolution: the chassis packages are versioned independently,
//!   not in lockstep, so each discovered package resolves its own target. A seed
//!   (a package the contract names in `[requires]`) resolves the greatest
//!   published version its named range allows; a companion (in the chassis scope
//!   but unnamed) resolves within a caret of its current pin, so it never crosses
//!   its own major silently. `--to` overrides the primary seed's target only, so
//!   it can never force a companion onto a version it never published.
//! - The compat gate is the contract's own `[requires]` range: a forced `--to`
//!   outside the primary seed's range is the "major upgrade requires the
//!   migration path" refusal, so the version policy lives in the template, not
//!   the CLI.
//! - Chassis packages are discovered from `[requires]` by unscoped name (so
//!   `node` is naturally skipped and `toolchain` resolves to `@statecrafting/…`),
//!   then every exact-pinned dependency in the discovered scope is bumped
//!   (catching companions like `@statecrafting/hiqlite-native`) with no hardcoded
//!   scope in the CLI.
//! - Every git/npm/node side effect sits behind [`Runner`] so `cargo test` runs
//!   fully offline (the spec 103 §1 discipline: never gate tests on the outside
//!   world). The pure planning is exercised directly.
