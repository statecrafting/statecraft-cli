// The member contract (spec 042): what a member is to the thing that calls it.
//
// A member is a binary built from this repository that answers one reserved
// flag, `--member-manifest`, with a machine-readable description of itself,
// and whose stdout the umbrella (statecraft-cli 008) can render without
// knowing which member produced it. This module holds the manifest type, the
// three declarations, the serializer, and the one entry each member binary
// runs. No verb moves between layers here; the entrypoints reuse the spec 005
// dispatcher (D-4) so a verb behaves identically through `observatory` and
// through its member binary.
