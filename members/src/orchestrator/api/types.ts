// The versioned wire contract (spec 022 B-2, spec 027 B-1): every response
// shape the daemon serves, the one success/failure envelope they travel in,
// and the stable error-kind tokens clients branch on. Nothing in this file
// performs I/O or reads state; it is the single place the CLI (spec 023), the
// web UI (spec 024), and the server itself agree on shapes, so a change here
// is visible to every client at compile time rather than at runtime.
//
// The envelope follows statecraft-cli's own output pattern: `{ok: true,
// data}` or `{ok: false, error: {kind, message}}`, never a bare payload and
// never an HTTP status alone carrying the meaning.
//
// v2 is the project-scoped contract (spec 027). One daemon answers for many
// projects, so every project-scoped fact lives under `/api/projects/<name>/`
// and carries its project in the payload; the facts that are genuinely global
// (daemon meta, the account's quota pool, the event stream) stay global, with
// every event naming the project it belongs to. There are no v1 aliases.
