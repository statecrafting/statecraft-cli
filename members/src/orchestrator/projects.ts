// The registry of target repositories the orchestrator may drive (spec 025):
// the honest answer to "what may this daemon touch, and why". Every target is
// registered, qualified, and journaled before a single session is driven
// against it; the self-hosted checkout is not special, it is simply the first
// registered project.
//
// Storage is a third hash-linked chain under the daemon home, opened through
// spec 011's parameterized `openJournal(dir, basename)` seam with the basename
// "projects", exactly as spec 020's decision ledger does (B-2, "same
// implementation, third chain"). Registry state is never a table: register,
// arm, disarm, requalify, and remove each append a record carrying its source,
// and the current set of projects is derived by folding them (foldProjects).
//
// Two roots, never conflated (B-3). The daemon home (this checkout's
// data/orchestrator/) holds the lock, the log, and this chain. A project's
// state root is <repoDir>/data/orchestrator/, the same layout the self-hosted
// run already uses, so spec 011/020 machinery and an offline `journal verify`
// work unchanged when pointed at any project.
//
// Write discipline (B-5): nothing here writes inside a target except through
// the qualification probe's `spec-spine compile`, which refreshes that repo's
// own deterministic .derived/ artifacts and never touches an authored file.
// The registry itself only ever reads a target, and `~/.claude` stays
// read-only for every code path (spec 001 B-7).
