// The standby daemon and its multi-project scheduler (spec 026): the layer
// that stops the daemon dying of success. A run reaching completed or failed
// used to end the process, taking the API and the UI with it, so "mission
// complete" and "not running" were the same observable (010 A-1). Here a
// terminal run is simply the end of that project's turn: the process, the
// identity lock, and the API stay up, and the scheduler looks for the next
// project with work.
//
// The whole policy is registration order (D-1). Above spec 021's per-run loop
// sits one cycle:
//
//   1. re-fold the project registry (025) and observe every project once,
//   2. resume any paused run whose human decision has arrived (B-3's
//      priority half), else
//   3. give the flight slot to the first armed, qualified project whose
//      registry read shows work its last conclusion did not already see,
//   4. and when nothing at all is schedulable, wait out a bounded scan
//      interval and start over (B-4).
//
// Three invariants shape the code below. There is exactly one flight slot:
// the scheduler awaits one project's drive() at a time, which is what makes
// "at most one live stage session globally" (010 B-5, D15) structural rather
// than checked. Quota is global (B-5): a parked run keeps the slot while it
// waits, so no other project can start a session before the spec 015 horizon
// resumes it. And there is one identity lock per daemon home (B-6): the
// scheduler holds it and every project's run is a `supervised` Daemon that
// takes none of its own, while each project's journals still take spec 011's
// per-chain writer lock inside that project's own state root.
//
// Nothing here journals a chain of its own. Runs, journals, and recovery
// semantics from 013, 011, and 021 are untouched; each project's evidence
// goes on living inside that project (010 D13). What standby knows that no
// journal records is transient by nature (what was observed on the last
// scan), so it is exposed as a snapshot and logged, and specs 027-029 render
// it.
