// The orchestrator daemon (spec 021): the long-lived process that composes
// every other kernel module into one serial run loop. Everything hard lives
// elsewhere (the journal's crash consistency, the state machine's legal
// transitions, the DAG's readiness, the quota scheduler's park/resume, the
// four stages' own driving); this module is their disciplined composition,
// trusted to be killed at any moment and resumed honestly from the journal
// alone (the same "state is never trusted from memory" discipline journal.ts
// itself establishes).
//
// Every side effect sits behind DaemonDeps (FR-002-style injection, mirroring
// every stage module's own seam convention): the DAG reader, the four stage
// seams (Runner, GitHubClient, VerifyRunner, BrowserVerifier), the session
// driver, a process inspector for identity-checked locking, a clock, a
// chunked sleep, an rng, and the four stage entry points themselves
// (defaulting to the real runBuildStage/runShipStage/runShepherdStage/
// runVerifyStage, overridable wholesale in tests). Production wiring lives in
// createProductionDaemonDeps(); tests drive the Daemon class against fixture
// deps, never a real `claude`, `gh`, or `spec-spine` subprocess.
//
// Spec 026 supersedes two things here and nothing else. First, the run loop
// no longer owns the process's fate: it reports why it stopped (a LoopYield)
// so a supervisor can outlive a terminal run. Second, a `supervised` instance
// is one project's run inside spec 026's standby daemon: it takes no identity
// lock of its own (the supervisor holds the one lock for the daemon home,
// 026 B-6) and yields the flight slot when its run pauses on a human
// decision, instead of waiting that pause out. A quota park is deliberately
// not a yield: the account's quota is one pool, so that wait belongs where
// nothing else can start (026 B-5).
