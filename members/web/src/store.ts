// The SPA's data layer (spec 024 B-3, B-7).
//
// Two rules shape all of it. First, nothing here derives state from a control
// it just issued or from an event payload: every value on screen comes from a
// read route the daemon answered, so a rendered number is always something
// the journal said, not something this page inferred (B-7, "no optimistic
// UI"). Events are a trigger to refetch and a scrollback, never a source of
// truth. Second, not knowing is a state: a resource that has never loaded is
// `null` rather than an empty object, and a daemon that stopped answering
// sets `reach: "unreachable"` rather than leaving the last good fold on
// screen looking live (AC-2).
//
// v2 adds a third rule (spec 027 B-3): a scoped value is only ever shown under
// the project it was read from. The store holds one selected project, reads
// the four scoped routes through that project's sub-client, and drops those
// folds outright when the selection changes, because carrying one project's
// DAG under another's name is the misstatement of scope v2 exists to prevent.
//
// Spec 029 adds the fleet's half of that: the standby view needs every
// registered project's backlog at once (B-2), which is a fold per project
// rather than one more global route. Those folds are kept in their own map,
// keyed by project name, and are read on demand rather than with every
// refresh (D-1).
