#               PATH. Set it once here rather than in every caller.
#   BASE        the ref the coupling gate compares against. Resolved from
#               the repository rather than assumed to be origin/main
#               (spec 072); override it here or on the command line.

## The governed loop, read-only throughout. A gate that writes repairs what it
## is meant to judge (spec 046), so this uses `compile --check` and never
## `compile`.
## `--fail-on-unresolved` is opt-in by design (spec 050): a spec ratified before
## it is built (108 today) legitimately carries an unresolved unit while the
## work is pending. Add the flag once every approved spec is implemented.
